Undefied-C Library
==================

	Undefiend -C is an extension if the C language and the POSIX standard
that adds a number of data structures, as well as the functions for
manipullate to those existing in these two standards. The structure of data
added are as follows:

	  - Simple linked lists,
	  - Simple circular linked lists,
	  - Double linked lists,
	  - Diuble circular linked lists,
	  - Fifo sructures,
	  - Lifo sructures.

	  In addition to adding structure, Undefined-C modifies existing
functions without chaging their interfaces or return values. These
changes allow for better error handling while remaining retro-compatible
with pre-existing source codes.

For more information, it is possible to view the manual pages of Undefied-C
in using the 'man.sh' script with the following command line:

	.man.sh [3] <manpage>

	Source files can be edited in Emacs in using the script 'emacs.sh' with
the following command line:

	./emacs.sh <file_path>

	This script is used to update the header of the source file automatically
in case of change.
